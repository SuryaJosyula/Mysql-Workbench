Unable to create new store procedures. 
Solution :  Deprecate the version to 6.2.3 and open.

In store procedures field value is taking null value?
Solution :  I used mamp first to start MYSQL server which took 8889 as my port.MySQL is having many bigs here.
I later tried it with the XAMP server for running my MYSQL Servers. It had all done a magic. Stored procedures are storing queires and everything works fine now.
