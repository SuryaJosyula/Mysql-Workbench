In store procedures field value is taking null value?
Unable to create new store procedures.?

Solution:

I used mamp first to start MYSQL server which took 8889 as my port.MySQL is having many bugs here.
I later tried it with the XAMP server for running my MYSQL Servers. It had all done a magic. 
Stored procedures are storing queires and everything works fine now.

grant all on *.* to 'root'@'%' identified by 'password' with grant option;
